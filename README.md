# Recommendation System (Popularity Based)

In this Python project, I am trying to build a movie recommendation system using *viewer ratings* and *view count*.

- I will use two different *csv* files and merge them together to build a single *DataFrame*
- Then Perform *grouping*, *sorting* and rebuilding a separate dataset including
    - Movie title
    - Average rating
    - View counts

Finally, I filter top 10 movies based on a **criteria** I set for deciding a movie is popular or not.

## üèÜ Lessons Learned

1. Merging two *csvs* into one *DataFrame*
2. *Criteria* for popularity based recommender system
